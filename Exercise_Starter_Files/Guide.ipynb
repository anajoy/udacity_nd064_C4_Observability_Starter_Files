    "Suppose that you are working on **improving the customer service at a grocery store**. In the space provided on the right, see if you can write at least three SLOs related to this goal.\n",

    "Keep in mind that your SLOs should:\n",
    "* Be related to the customer service objective\n",
    "* Be measurable\n",
    "* Be something you can control\n",
    "* Specify a certain level of service (e.g., 99%)\n",
    "* Specify a period of time (e.g., per day, per month, etc.)"

    "\n",
    "For example, if we took *wait time* or *bagger availability*, the SLOs might be something like:\n",
    "* **99% of customers will wait in line at the checkout counter for less than 5 minutes per month.**\n",
    "* **All open checkout lanes will have 1 or more bagger 95% of the time per day.**\n",
